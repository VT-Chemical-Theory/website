## ARC MISSION
Advanced Research Computing (ARC) provides centralized support for research computing by building, operating and promoting the use of advanced cyberinfrastructure at Virginia Tech. ARC seeks to maximize research productivity at Virginia Tech through interdisciplinary collaborations that connect researchers to new opportunities in computing and data driven research. ARC also provides a competitive advantage to VT research in obtaining external research support. Towards this end, ARC delivers a comprehensive ecosystem consisting of advanced computational systems, large-scale data storage, visualization facilities, software, and consulting services. By fostering strategic partnerships, ARC serves to cultivate advanced computing infrastructure as a platform for collaboration and helps secure the position of Virginia Tech as a leader in education, innovation, and research. ARC offers and hosts conferences, seminars, and scientific computing courses catering to all levels of academia while creating a more socially inclusive environment and broadening the collective insight of the field through increased diversity.
