- PhD Chemistry (2021 - Present), Virginia Tech, VA. <a href="http://www.valeriewelborn.com/">Welborn Group</a>

I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2020 with a BS in Chemistry and a minor in Biosciences and Bioengineering.

My undergraduate research in Dr. Pradeepkumarâ€™s group focused on prediction algorithms and Machine Learning-assisted ligand design for stabilisation of G-Quadruplexes and I-Motifs. After completion of my degree I worked with Swiggy, a food delivery app, where I worked on campaign benchmarking and customer engagement. I am currently a graduate student in the Welborn group and my work focuses on facilitating molecular dynamics simulations of polymer-based materials.
