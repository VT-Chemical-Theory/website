##Bio
Mark earned his BSc in Chemistry from Western Carolina University in 2019, followed by a MSc in Chemistry in 2022.

During his master's program, his research focused on the application of chemometric analysis of infrared spectra to determine mosquito gonotrophic life stages. Now as a Ph.D. student, Mark is focused on modeling aggregates of the protein alpha-synuclein, which has been implicated as the main constituent of Lewy bodies involved in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other Lewy body diseases.
